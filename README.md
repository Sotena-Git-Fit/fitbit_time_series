# fitbit time series

For this project we were given Fitbit activity data. 

Goals:

1. Analyze activities and order dataset by time
2. Create a predictive model by splitting data into train and test
3. Create predictions for missing two weeks.

Files needed to reproduce are contained in this repo. There are no special env.py files.
